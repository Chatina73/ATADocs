# Microsoft Defender for Identity for US Government offerings

The [!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)] GCC High offering utilizes the same underlying technologies and capabilities as the commercial instance of [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)]. A list of feature variances can be found in the [Service Description](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/ems-azure-atp-govt-service-description).

## Get started with US Government offerings

The [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] GCC, GCC High, and Department of Defense (DoD) offerings are built on the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud and is designed to inter-operate with Microsoft 365 GCC, GCC High, and DoD. Use [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] public documentation as a [starting point](install-step1.md) for deploying and operating the service and refer to the [Service Description](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/ems-mdi-govt-service-description), which details all changes from functionality or features specific to the GCC, GCC High, and DoD environments.
