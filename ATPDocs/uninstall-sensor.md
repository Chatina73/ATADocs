This article describes how to uninstall the [!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)] sensor from domain controllers for the following scenarios:

1. Uninstall a sensor from a domain controller

## Uninstall a sensor from a domain controller

The following steps describe how to uninstall a sensor from a domain controller.

1. Sign in to the domain controller with local administrator privileges.
1. From the Windows **Start** menu, click **Settings** > **Control Panel** > **Add/ Remove Programs**.
1. Select the sensor installation, click **Uninstall**, and follow the instructions to remove the sensor.

This scenario can occur when a domain controller was deleted without first uninstalling the sensor, and the sensor still appears in the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] portal.

1. In the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] portal, go to **Configuration** and under the **System** section, select **Sensors**.
1. Locate the orphaned sensor and, at the end of the row, click **Delete** (trash can icon).
