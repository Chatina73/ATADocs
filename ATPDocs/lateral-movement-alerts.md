# Tutorial: Lateral movement alerts

Typically, cyberattacks are launched against any accessible entity, such as a low-privileged user, and then quickly move laterally until the attacker gains access to valuable assets. Valuable assets can be sensitive accounts, domain administrators, or highly sensitive data. [!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)] identifies these advanced threats at the source throughout the entire attack kill chain and classifies them into the following phases:

1. [Reconnaissance](reconnaissance-alerts.md)
1. [Compromised credentials](compromised-credentials-alerts.md)
1. **Lateral Movements**
1. [Domain dominance](domain-dominance-alerts.md)
1. [Exfiltration](exfiltration-alerts.md)

To learn more about how to understand the structure, and common components of all [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] security alerts, see [Understanding security alerts](understanding-security-alerts.md). For information about **True positive (TP)**, **Benign true positive (B-TP)**, and **False positive (FP)**, see [security alert classifications](understanding-security-alerts.md#security-alert-classifications).

The following security alerts help you identify and remediate **Lateral Movement** phase suspicious activities detected by [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] in your network. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to understand, classify, remediate, and prevent the following types of attacks:

## Suspected exploitation attempt on Windows Print Spooler service (external ID 2415)

**Description**

Adversaries might exploit the Windows Print Spooler service to perform privileged file operations in an improper manner. An attacker who has (or obtains) the ability to execute code on the target, and who successfully exploits the vulnerability, could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a target system. If run against a domain controller, the attack would allow a compromised non-administrator account to perform actions against a domain controller as SYSTEM.

This functionally allows any attacker who enters the network to instantly elevate privileges to Domain Administrator, steal all domain credentials, and distribute further malware as a Domain Admin.

**TP, B-TP or FP**
1. Determine whether the Print Spooler service is frequently used over the network to install printer drivers on domain controllers. This should rarely happen.
2. Check if the source computer is running an attack tool such as Mimikatz or Impacket.
3. If the answers to these questions is yes, it's a true positive. Follow the instructions in the next section to understand the scope of the breach.

**Understand the scope of the breach**
1. Investigate the source computer using [these instructions](investigate-a-computer.md).
2. Investigate the target domain controller, and identify activities that occurred after the attack.

**Suggested remediation**

1. Contain the source computer.
    - Find the tool that performed the attack and remove it.
    - Look for users who were logged on around the same time that the activity occurred. These users might also be compromised. If you've configured the relevant high-risk user policies in Azure Active Directory Identity Protection, you can use the *Confirm user compromised* action in the Microsoft Cloud App Security portal.
2. Due to the risk of the domain controller being compromised, install the security updates for [CVE-2021-3452](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527) on Windows domain controllers, before installing on member servers and workstations.
3. You can use the Defender for Identity built-in security assessment that tracks the availability of Print spooler services on domain controllers. [Learn more](cas-isp-print-spooler.md).

 

## Remote code execution over DNS (external ID 2036)

**TP, B-TP, or FP?**

Successfully resolving IPs to computers in the organization is critical to identify pass-the-ticket attacks from one computer to another.

1. Check if the IP address of one or both computers belong to a subnet that is allocated from an undersized DHCP pool, for example, VPN, VDI or WiFi?
1. Is the IP address shared (for example, by a NAT device)?
1. Is the sensor not resolving one or more of the destination IP addresses? If a destination IP address is not resolved, it may indicate that the correct ports between sensor and devices are not open correctly.

    If the answer to any of the previous questions is **yes**, check if the source and destinations computers are the same. If they are the same, it is an **FP** and there were no real attempts at **pass-the-ticket**.

The [Remote Credential Guard](/windows/security/identity-protection/remote-credential-guard) feature of RDP connections, when used with Windows 10 on Windows Server 2016 and newer, can cause **B-TP** alerts.
Using the alert evidence, check if the user made a remote desktop connection from the source computer to the destination computer.

1. Check for correlating evidence.
1. If there is correlating evidence, check if the RDP connection was made using Remote Credential Guard.
1. If the answer is yes, **Close** the security alert as a **T-BP** activity.

There are custom applications that forward tickets on behalf of users. These applications have delegation rights to user tickets.

1. Is a custom application type like the one previously described, currently on the destination computers? Which services is the application running? Are the services acting on behalf of users, for example, accessing databases?
    - If the answer is yes, **Close** the security alert as a **T-BP** activity.
1. Is the destination computer a delegation server?
    - If the answer is yes, **Close** the security alert, and exclude that computer as a **T-BP** activity.

**Understand the scope of the breach**

1. Investigate the [source and destination computers](investigate-a-computer.md).
1. Investigate the [compromised user](investigate-a-computer.md).

**Suggested remediation and steps for prevention**

1. Reset the password of the source user and enable MFA or, if you have configured the relevant high-risk user policies in Azure Active Directory Identity Protection, you can use the [**Confirm user compromised**](/cloud-app-security/accounts#governance-actions) action in the Cloud App Security portal.
1. Contain the source and destination computers.
1. Find the tool that performed the attack and remove it.
1. Look for users logged on around the same time as the activity, as they may also be compromised.

1. If you have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint installed – use **klist.exe purge** to delete all the tickets of the specified logon session and prevent future usage of the tickets.

## Suspected NTLM authentication tampering (external ID 2039)

In June 2019, Microsoft published [Security Vulnerability CVE-2019-1040](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1040), announcing discovery of a new tampering vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, when a "man-in-the-middle" attack is able to successfully bypass NTLM MIC (Message Integrity Check) protection.

Malicious actors that successfully exploit this vulnerability have the ability to downgrade NTLM security features, and may successfully create authenticated sessions on behalf of other accounts. Unpatched Windows Servers are at risk from this vulnerability.

In this detection, a [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] security alert is triggered when NTLM authentication requests suspected of exploiting security vulnerability identified in [CVE-2019-1040](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1040) are made against a domain controller in the network.

## Suspected NTLM relay attack (Exchange account) (external ID 2037)

**Description**

An Exchange Server can be configured to trigger NTLM authentication with the Exchange Server account to a remote http server, run by an attacker. The server waits for the Exchange Server communication to relay its own sensitive authentication to any other server, or even more interestingly to Active Directory over LDAP, and grabs the authentication information.

Once the relay server receives the NTLM authentication, it provides a challenge that was originally created by the target server. The client responds to the challenge, preventing an attacker from taking the response, and using it to continue NTLM negotiation with the target domain controller.

In this detection, an alert is triggered when [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] identify use of Exchange account credentials from a suspicious source.

## Suspected overpass-the-hash attack (encryption downgrade) (external ID 2008)

*Previous name:* Encryption downgrade activity

**Description**

Encryption downgrade is a method of weakening Kerberos using encryption downgrade of different fields of the protocol, normally encrypted using the highest levels of encryption. A weakened encrypted field can be an easier target to offline brute force attempts. Various attack methods utilize weak Kerberos encryption cyphers. In this detection, [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] learns the Kerberos encryption types used by computers and users, and alerts you when a weaker cypher is used that is unusual for the source computer, and/or user, and matches known attack techniques.

In an over-pass-the-hash attack, an attacker can use a weak stolen hash to create a strong ticket, with a Kerberos AS request. In this detection,  instances are detected where the AS_REQ message encryption type from the source computer is downgraded, when compared to the previously learned behavior (the computer used AES).

**Learning period**

Not applicable

**TP, B-TP, or FP?**

1. Determine if the smartcard configuration recently changed.
    - Did the accounts involved recently have smartcard configurations changes?

      If the answer is yes, **Close** the security alert as a **T-BP** activity.

Some legitimate resources don't support strong encryption ciphers and may trigger this alert.

1. Do all source users share something?
    1. For example, are all of your marketing personnel accessing a specific resource that could cause the alert to be triggered?
    1. Check the resources accessed by those tickets.
       - Check this in Active Directory by checking the attribute *msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes*, of the resource service account.
    1. If there is only one accessed resource, check if it is a valid resource for these users to access.

      If the answer to one of the previous questions is **yes**, it is likely to be a **T-BP** activity. Check if the resource can support a strong encryption cipher, implement a stronger encryption cipher where possible, and **Close** the security alert.

**Understand the scope of the breach**

1. Investigate the [source computer](investigate-a-computer.md).
1. Investigate the [compromised user](investigate-a-computer.md).

**Suggested remediation and steps for prevention**

**Remediation**

1. Reset the password of the source user and enable MFA or, if you have configured the relevant high-risk user policies in Azure Active Directory Identity Protection, you can use the [**Confirm user compromised**](/cloud-app-security/accounts#governance-actions) action in the Cloud App Security portal.
1. Contain the source computer.
1. Find the tool that performed the attack and remove it.
1. Look for users logged on around the time of the activity, as they may also be compromised. Reset their passwords and enable MFA or, if you have configured the relevant high-risk user policies in Azure Active Directory Identity Protection, you can use the [**Confirm user compromised**](/cloud-app-security/accounts#governance-actions) action in the Cloud App Security portal.

**Prevention**

1. Configure your domain to support strong encryption cyphers, and remove *Use Kerberos DES encryption types*. Learn more about [encryption types and Kerberos](/archive/blogs/openspecification/windows-configurations-for-kerberos-supported-encryption-type).
1. Make sure the domain functional level is set to support strong encryption cyphers.
1. Give preference to using applications that support strong encryption cyphers.

## Suspected overpass-the-hash attack (Kerberos) (external ID 2002)

*Previous name:* Unusual Kerberos protocol implementation (potential overpass-the-hash attack)

**Description**

Attackers use tools that implement various protocols such as Kerberos and SMB in non-standard ways. While Microsoft Windows accepts this type of network traffic without warnings, [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] is able to recognize potential malicious intent. The behavior is indicative of techniques such as over-pass-the-hash, Brute Force, and advanced ransomware exploits such as WannaCry, are used.

## Suspected SMB packet manipulation (CVE-2020-0796 exploitation) - (preview) (external ID 2406)

**Description**

03/12/2020 Microsoft published [CVE-2020-0796](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0796), announcing that a newly remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Server Message Block 3.1.1 (SMBv3) protocol handles certain requests. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the ability to execute code on the target server or client. Unpatched Windows servers are at risk from this vulnerability.

In this detection, a [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] security alert is triggered when SMBv3 packet suspected of exploiting the CVE-2020-0796 security vulnerability are made against a domain controller in the network.

**Learning period**

Not applicable

**TP, B-TP, or FP?**

1. Are the involved domain controllers up-to-date and patched against CVE-2020-0796?
    - If the computers are up-to-date and patched, we expect the attack to fail, **Close** the security alert as a failed attempt.

**Understand the scope of the breach**

1. Investigate the [source computer](investigate-a-computer.md).
1. Investigate the destination DC.

**Suggested remediation and steps for prevention**

**Remediation**

1. Contain the source computer.
1. Find the tool that performed the attack and remove it.
1. Look for users logged on around the same time as the suspicious activity, as they may also be compromised. Reset their passwords and enable MFA or, if you have configured the relevant high-risk user policies in Azure Active Directory Identity Protection, you can use the [**Confirm user compromised**](/cloud-app-security/accounts#governance-actions) action in the Cloud App Security portal.
1. If your have computers with operating systems that don't support [KB4551762](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4551762), we recommend disabling the SMBv3 compression feature in the environment, as described in the [Workarounds](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0796) section.

**Prevention**

1. Make sure all devices in the environment are up-to-date, and patched against [CVE-2020-0796](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0796).
