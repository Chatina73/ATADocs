# Change Microsoft Defender for Identity portal configuration - domain connectivity password

## Change the domain connectivity password

If you need to modify the Domain Connectivity Password, make sure that the password you enter is correct. If it is not, the [!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)] sensor service stops for all deployed sensors.

If you suspect that this happened, look at the Microsoft.Tri.sensor-Errors.log file for the following errors: `The supplied credential is invalid.`

Follow this procedure to update the Domain Connectivity password on the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] portal:

> [!NOTE]
> This is the user name and password from the Active Directory on-premises deployment and not from Azure AD.

1. Open the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] portal by accessing the portal URL.

1. Select the settings option on the toolbar and select **Configuration**.

1. Select **Directory Services**.

1. Under **Password**, change the password.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Enter an Active Directory user and password here, not Azure Active Directory.

1. Click **Save**.

1. In the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] portal, select **Configuration**.
1. Under **System**, select **Sensors** page and check the status of the sensors.
