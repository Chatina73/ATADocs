# Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) to [!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The final release of ATA is [generally available](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4568997/update-3-for-microsoft-advanced-threat-analytics-1-9). ATA will end Mainstream Support on January 12, 2021. Extended Support will continue until January 2026. For more information, read [our blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/end-of-mainstream-support-for-advanced-threat-analytics-january/ba-p/1539181).

Use this guide to move from an existing ATA installation to the ([!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)]) service. The guide explains [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] prerequisites and requirements, and details how to plan and then complete your move. Validation steps and tips to take advantage of the latest threat protection and security solutions with [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] after installation are also included.

To learn more about the differences between ATA and [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)], see the [[!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] frequently asked questions](technical-faq.md#what-is-azure-atp).

In this guide you will:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Review and confirm [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] service prerequisites
> - Document your existing ATA configuration
> - Plan your move
> - Set up and configure your [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)]  service
> - Perform post move checks and verification
> - Decommission ATA after completing the move

> [!NOTE]
> Moving to [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] from ATA is possible from any ATA version. However, as data cannot be moved from ATA to [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)], it is recommended to retain your ATA Center data and alerts required for ongoing investigations until all ATA alerts are closed or remediated.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Active Directory tenant with at least one global/security administrator is required to create a [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] instance. Each [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] instance supports a multiple Active Directory forest boundary and Forest Functional Level (FFL) of Windows 2003 and above.

- [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] requires .Net Framework 4.7 or later and may require a domain controller (restart) if your current .Net Framework version is not 4.7 or later.

- Make sure your domain controllers meet all the [[!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensor requirements](prerequisites.md#azure-atp-sensor-requirements) and your environment meets all [[!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] requirements](prerequisites.md).

- Validate that all domain controllers you plan to use have sufficient internet access to the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] service. Check and confirm your domain controllers meet the [[!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] proxy configuration requirements](configure-proxy.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This migration guide is designed for [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensors only.

## Plan

Make sure to gather the following information before starting your move:

1. Account details for your [Directory Services](install-step2.md) account.
1. Syslog notification [settings](setting-syslog.md).
1. Email [notification details](notifications.md).
1. ATA roles group membership
1. VPN integration
1. Alert exclusions
    - Exclusions are not transferable from ATA to [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)], so details of each exclusion are required to [replicate the exclusions in [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)]](excluding-entities-from-detections.md).
1. Account details for HoneyToken accounts.
    - If you don't already have dedicated HoneyToken accounts, learn more about [HoneyTokens in [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)]](install-step7.md) and create new accounts to use for this purpose.
1. Complete list of all entities (computers, groups, users) you wish to manually tag as Sensitive entities.
    - Learn more about the importance of [Sensitive entities](sensitive-accounts.md) in [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)].
1. Report scheduling [details](reports.md) (list of reports and scheduled timing).

> [!NOTE]
> Do not uninstall the ATA Center until all ATA Gateways are removed. Uninstalling the ATA Center with ATA Gateways still running leaves your organization exposed with no threat protection.

## Move

Complete your move to [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] in two easy steps:

### Step 1: Create and install [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] instance and sensors

1. [Create your new [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] instance](install-step1.md)

1. Uninstall the ATA Lightweight Gateway on all domain controllers.

1. Install the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] Sensor on all domain controllers:
    - [Download the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensor files](install-step3.md).
    - [Retrieve your [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] Access Key](install-step3.md#download-the-setup-package).
    - [Install [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensors on your domain controllers](install-step4.md).

### Step 2: Configure and validate [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] instance

- [Configure the Sensor](install-step5.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Certain tasks in the following list cannot be completed before installing [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensors and then completing an initial sync, such as selecting entities for manual **Sensitive** tagging. Allow up to 2 hours for the initial sync to be completed.

#### Configuration

Sign in to the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] portal and complete the following configuration tasks.

| Step    | Action | Status |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| 1  | Set [delayed updates on a selection of domain controllers](sensor-update.md) | - [ ] |
| 2  | [Directory Services](install-step2.md) account details| - [ ] |
| 3  | Configure [Syslog notifications](setting-syslog.md) | - [ ] |
| 4  | [Integrate VPN](install-step6-vpn.md) information| - [ ] |
| 5  | Configure [WDATP integration](integrate-mde.md)| - [ ] |
| 6  | Set [HoneyTokens](install-step7.md) accounts| - [ ] |
| 7  | Tag [Sensitive entities](sensitive-accounts.md)| - [ ] |
| 8  | Create [Security alert exclusions](excluding-entities-from-detections.md)| - [ ] |
| 9 | [Email notification toggles](notifications.md) | - [ ] |
| 10  | [Schedule report settings](reports.md) (list of reports and scheduled timing)| - [ ] |
| 11  | Configure [Role based permissions](role-groups.md) | - [ ] |
| 12  | [SIEM notification configuration (IP address)](configure-event-collection.md#siemsyslog)| - [ ] |

#### Validation

Within the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] portal:

- Review any [health alerts](health-center.md) for signs of service issues.
- Review [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] [Sensor error logs](troubleshooting-using-logs.md) for any unusual errors.

## After the move

This section of the guide explains the actions that can be performed after completing your move.

> [!NOTE]
> Import of existing security alerts from ATA to [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] are not supported. Make sure to record or remediate all existing ATA alerts before decommissioning the ATA Center.

- **Decommission the ATA Center**  
  - To reference the ATA Center data after the move, we recommend keeping the center data online for a period of time. After decommissioning the ATA Center, the number of resources can typically be reduced, especially if the resources are a Virtual Machine.

- **Back up Mongo DB**  
  - If you wish to keep the ATA data indefinitely, [back up Mongo DB](/advanced-threat-analytics/ata-database-management#backing-up-the-ata-database).

## Mission accomplished
