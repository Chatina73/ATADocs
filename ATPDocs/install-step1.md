# Quickstart: Create your [!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)] instance

In this quickstart, you'll create your [!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)] instance in the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] portal. In [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)], you'll have a single instance, previously called a workspace. A single instance enables you to manage multiple forests from a single pane of glass.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] data centers are deployed in Europe, UK, North America/Central America/Caribbean and Asia. Your instance is created automatically in the data center that is geographically closest to your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Once created, [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] instances aren't movable.

## Prerequisites
