[!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)] can notify you when it detects a suspicious activity and issues a security alert or a health alert via email.

To receive notifications to a specific email address, set the following parameters:

1. In the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] portal, select the settings option on the toolbar and select **Configuration**.

    ![[!INCLUDE [Product short.](includes/product-short.md)] configuration settings icon](media/config-menu.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - Emails are only sent for notifications with defined email addresses.
    > - Email alerts for suspicious activities are only sent when the suspicious activity is created.
