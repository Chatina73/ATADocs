# Security assessment: Riskiest lateral movement paths (LMP)

## What are Risky lateral movement paths?

[!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)] continuously monitors your environment to identify **sensitive** accounts with the riskiest lateral movement paths that expose a security risk, and reports on these accounts to assist you in managing your environment. Paths are considered risky if they have three or more non-sensitive accounts that can expose the **sensitive** account to credential theft by malicious actors.

- [MITRE ATT&CK Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008/)

## What risk do risky lateral movement paths pose?

Organizations that fail to secure their **sensitive** accounts leave the door unlocked for malicious actors.

Malicious actors, much like thieves, often look for the easiest and quietest way into any environment. Sensitive accounts with risky lateral movement paths are windows of opportunities for attackers and can expose risks.

For example, the riskiest paths are more readily visible to attackers and, if compromised, can give an attacker access to your organization's most sensitive entities.

## How do I use this security assessment?

1. Use the report table to discover which of your **sensitive** accounts have risky LMPs.
