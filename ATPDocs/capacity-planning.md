# Plan capacity for [!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)]

In this guide, you determine how many [!INCLUDE [Product long](includes/product-long.md)] sensors you need.

## Prerequisites

- Download the [[!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] Sizing Tool](https://aka.ms/aatpsizingtool).
- Review the [[!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] architecture](architecture.md) article.
- Review the [[!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] prerequisites](prerequisites.md) article.

## Use the sizing tool

The recommended and simplest way to determine capacity for your [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] deployment is to use the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] Sizing Tool. If you're unable to use the tool, you can manually gather traffic information. For more information the manual method, see the [Domain controller traffic estimator](#manual-sizing) section at the bottom of this article.

1. Run the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] Sizing Tool, **TriSizingTool.exe**, from the zip file you downloaded.
1. When the tool finishes running, open the Excel file results.
1. In the Excel file, locate and click on the **Azure ATP Summary** sheet. The other sheet isn't needed since it's for ATA planning.
    ![Sample capacity planning tool](media/capacity-tool.png)

1. Locate the **Busy Packets/sec** field in the Azure ATP sensor table in the results Excel file and make a note of it.
1. Match your **Busy Packets/sec** field to the **PACKETS PER SECOND** field in the [[!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensor table](#sizing) section of this article. Use the fields to determine the memory and CPU that will be used by the sensor.

## <a name="sizing"></a> [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensor sizing

A [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensor can support the monitoring of a domain controller based on the amount of network traffic the domain controller generates. The following table is an estimate. The final amount that the sensor parses is dependent on the amount of traffic and the distribution of traffic.

The following CPU and Random Access Memory (RAM) capacity refers to the **sensor's own consumption**, not the domain controller capacity.

|Packets per second|CPU (cores)\*|Memory\*\* (GB)|
|----|----|-----|
|0-1k|0.25|2.50|
|1k-5k|0.75|6.00|
|5k-10k|1.00|6.50|
|10k-20k|2.00|9.00|
|20k-50k|3.50|9.50|
|50k-75k |3.50|9.50|
|75k-100k|3.50|9.50|

\* This includes physical cores, not hyper-threaded cores.  
\*\* Random-access memory (RAM)

When determining sizing, note the following items:

- Total number of cores that the sensor service will use.  
It's recommended that you don't work with hyper-threaded cores. Working with hyper-threaded cores can result in [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensor health issues.
- Total amount of memory that the sensor service will use.
- If the domain controller doesn't have the resources required by the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensor, domain controller performance isn't affected. However, the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensor might not operate as expected.
- When running as a virtual machine, all memory is required to be allocated to the virtual machine at all times.
- For optimal performance, set the **Power Option** of the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] sensor to **High Performance**.
- A minimum of 2 cores is required.
- A minimum of 6 GB of hard drive space is required, 10 GB is recommended, including space needed for the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] binaries and logs.

### Dynamic memory

> [!NOTE]
> When running as a virtual machine (VM) all memory is required to be allocated to VM at all times.

|VM running on|Description|
|------------|-------------|
|Hyper-V|Ensure that **Enable Dynamic Memory** is not enabled for the VM.|
|VMWare|Ensure that the amount of memory configured and the reserved memory are the same, or select the following option in the VM setting â€“ **Reserve all guest memory (All locked)**.|
|Other virtualization host|Refer to the vendor supplied documentation on how to ensure that memory is fully allocated to the VM at all times. |

## <a name="manual-sizing"></a> Domain controller traffic estimation

If for some reason you can't use the [!INCLUDE [Product short](includes/product-short.md)] Sizing Tool, manually gather the packet/sec counter information from all your domain controllers. Gather the information for 24 hours with a low collection interval, approximately 5 seconds. Then, for each domain controller, calculate the daily average and the busiest period (15 minutes) average. The following sections present the instruction for how to collect the packets/sec counter from one domain controller.

There are various tools that you can use to discover the average packets per second of your domain controllers. If you don't have any tools that track this counter, you can use Performance Monitor to gather the required information.

To determine packets per second, do the following steps on each domain controller:

1. Open Performance Monitor.

    ![Performance monitor image](media/traffic-estimation-1.png)

1. Expand **Data Collector Sets**.

    ![Data collector sets image](media/traffic-estimation-2.png)

1. Right click **User Defined** and select **New** &gt; **Data Collector Set**.

    ![New data collector set image](media/traffic-estimation-3.png)

1. Enter a name for the collector set and select **Create Manually (Advanced)**.

1. Under **What type of data do you want to include?** select  **Create data logs, and Performance counter**.

    ![Type of data for new data collector set image](media/traffic-estimation-5.png)

1. Under **Which performance counters would you like to log**, click **Add**.

1. Expand **Network Adapter** and select **Packets/sec** and select the proper instance. If you aren't sure, you can select **&lt;All instances&gt;** and click **Add** and **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To perform this operation in a command line, run `ipconfig /all` to see the name of the adapter and configuration.

    ![Add performance counters image](media/traffic-estimation-7.png)

1. Change the **Sample interval** to **five seconds**.

1. Set the location where you want the data to be saved.

1. Under **Create the data collector set**,  select **Start this data collector set now**, and click **Finish**.

    You should now see the data collector set you created with a green triangle indicating that it's working.

1. After 24 hours, stop the data collector set, by right-clicking the data collector set and selecting **Stop**.

    ![Stop data collector set image](media/traffic-estimation-12.png)

1. In File Explorer, browse to the folder where the .blg file was saved and double-click it to open it in Performance Monitor.

1. Select the Packets/sec counter, and record the average and maximum values.
